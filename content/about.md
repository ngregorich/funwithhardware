Hi, I'm Nicholas Gregorich. AKA Nick. AKA Nico, Nik, Nic, Nich. I'm a hardwarista.

> hardwarista | *noun*: a person who makes and serves hardware to the public

I'm a bit more than a decade into my career as a...well, let's just say I put the general in generalist.

1. Have my undergrad and graduate in electrical engineering 
    * Included a thesis WITH KNOBS titled: *Audio Frequency Shifting On FPGA*
2. The first act of my career was doing FPGA applications  support and design services
3. Had a hobby in audio gear for makers (modular synthesizers) that grew into a company
    * Did schematics / layout / code for funky FPGA and ARM Cortex audio engines
    * Designed and manufactured hardware in China. Sometimes, QA is a full time job
    * Built e-commerce, customer service, logistics, book keeping (never again), etc
4. Did some FPGA / ARM consulting on an ultrasound catheter to localize afib
5. Got into regulated designs,  BLE, and DFM / DFT at an e-nicotine patch start up
    * Owned electrical, dual ARM Cortex bare metal C interfacing with iOS via BLE
6. Kept trying to help people quit smoking doing R&D and test at a lil vape start up
    * Electrical, C, C++, (micro)python, mynewt RTOS, and lots of pandas plotting

Visual learner? Tall bars are where I am already awesome. Shorter bars are where I'd like to be awesome(r).

I guess you could call this relatively rare breed a *full stack hardware engineer*. I know enough to be dangerous and build parts in SolidWorks, do schematics and layout in Altium, write firmware lately focused on bare metal C on STM32, and collect a whole lot of data and make it perdy in python / pandas / matplotlib.
