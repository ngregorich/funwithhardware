Hi, I'm Nicholas Gregorich. AKA Nick. AKA Nico, Nik, Nic, Nich. I'm a hardwarista.

    hardwarista | noun: a person who makes and serves hardware to the public

I'm a bit more than a decade into my career as a...well, I put the general in generalist.

    1. Have my undergrad and graduate in EE, including a thesis WITH KNOBS titled: Audio Frequency Shifting On FPGA
    2. The first act of my career was doing FPGA applications / field support and design services
    3. Had a hobby in audio electronics for makers (modular synthesizers) that grew into a full time job / company
        * At said company I did schematics / layout / code for funky FPGA and ARM Cortex based audio engines
        * I designed and manufactured mechanical hardware in China. Sometimes, QA is a full time job
        * Built out e-commerce, customer service, logistics, book keeping (never again), and so on
    4. Did some FPGA and ARM consulting on an ultrasound catheter for the heart to localize afib
    5. Got very familiar with regulated design, Bluetooth LE, and DFM / DFT working at an e-nicotine patch start up
        * Owned electrical design and dual ARM Cortex bare metal C including interfacing with iOS via BLE
    6. Continued trying to help people quit smoking doing electrical and firmware at a lil vape start up
        * R&D and some test including electrical, C, C++, (micro)python, mynewt RTOS, and lots of pandas plotting

Visual learner? This bar graph of my interests show the sweet spot of my current skills and what I need to continue learning.

I guess you could call this relatively rare breed a *full stack hardware engineer*. I know enough to be dangerous and build parts in SolidWorks, do schematics and layout in Altium, firmware lately focused on bare metal C on STM32, and collect a whole lot of data and make it perdy in python / pandas / matplotlib.
