The Mission The year is 2020. There&amp;rsquo;s this virus going around, but that&amp;rsquo;s a story for another blog.
We&amp;rsquo;ve all got a little extra time on our hands, so I want to dig into what it is I want to be able to build, acknowledge the skills I do have, fill in the gaps I don&amp;rsquo;t, and ship it (which in this case would simply mean calling it done-ish).</description>
